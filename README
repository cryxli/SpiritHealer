SpiritHealer
============

This project is a bukkit plugin to manage player deaths and kills. The current source is compatible to bukkit's r1.3.1-R1.0 release.


Description
-----------

Similar to the Spirit Healer of WoW this plugin prevents item drops on player death. After respawn the players can visit a Spirit Altar to get their items back. Players can only get their own items not items of other players.

The plugin also keeps track of whatever players kill. There are four categories:
- PvP (Player vs. player kills)
- Friendly mobs (Pigs, sheep...)
- Neutral mobs (Endermen, Wolves...)
- Aggressive mobs (Creeper, skeletons...)


Installation
------------

Offline:
- Build the plugin or download the JAR file
- Copy the JAR file to the "plugins" folder of your bukkit server
- Start the server once to generate the config file with default values
- Modify the config file as you please

In game:
- Create a new spirit altar by placing an Ender Stone on top of an Obsidian block.
- This only works in NORMAL worlds (not in the Nether or the End!)
- Only Ender Stone placed on Obsidian while the plugin is running are recognised as altars
- You can change the block types used to create altars in the config file of the plugin.


Use
---

- In game type "/frags" to see your current death/kill count
- "/frags d" to see detailed info by creature type
- After you died, visit a spirit altar to get your items back (Touch it with your bare hands.)
- The altar will punish you, if you touch it with anything but your bare hands
- If you die on the way to the altar, your inventory is lost. (Only one inventory is stored per player.)
